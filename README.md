| generation from button+problem with error | 4  | 23/12/2021 | implemented a button that would clear the old generated maze and generate a new one while also getting the occlusion culling to stay working. I managed to get the deletion and generation to work, the culling also worked except for the fact that it kept giving an error about something that should have been cleared during the deletion process. i was not able to get it solved this day even with the help of a professor though with his help i was able to rule out a decent amount of possible causes |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| problem with error                        | 4  | 24/12/2021 | i had made an appointment with the same professor to have a look at it again. Sadly however niether of us could resolve the problem for we determined it would need a complete rework of the system thus i had to do it another way which isn't as good as the system i was trying to make.                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
